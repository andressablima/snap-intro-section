## Overview

Project of section using drop drown menu and mobile menu with JavaScript

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the relevant dropdown menus on desktop and mobile when interacting with the navigation links
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

I started structuring HTML and then I started the CSS file, putting everything in place using grid and flebox, also putting the responsive part to different screen sizes. I used JavaScript for the hamburguer menu, so user can click on and open the show the items.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
